<strong>pages.</strong> This will allow you to quickly create RD hover Effect item on your site.</p>

To create an RD Hover item all you need is the URL of the image. The image can come from any source and be any size, you can also use images uploaded right from the <strong>Post Media Uploader</strong>.  
Just copy the URL of the image after you upload it</p>

<p>
Another important thing to remember is that the image must always have its width and height set. This is important to maintain the layout of the image wrapper; your site, and to make sure the hover functions properly. Luckily, when using the plugin it will attempt to get these values for you.
